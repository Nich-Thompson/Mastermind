# Master Mind
**Our ways of working**  
While using Git we will be using the Gitflow workflow. 
This means that we will use feature branches, the development, the quality assurance and the master branch. 
While working on features we will be using seperate feature branches. After a feature has been developed, the feature will be merged into the development branch. 
Before merging the developer will create a pull request and a minimum of two developers or team members will review the code and request changes if necessary. 
For each week there are milestones and if the milestones have been met, we will push the changes to the quality assurance. 
Here the code is tested for the last time and is pushes into the master branch.
